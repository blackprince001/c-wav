# C - Wav

Generating Wav files with C - Programming.

Wav file format documentation - [https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/wav/#wav-file-header](https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/wav/#wav-file-header)

I was not able to link the math.h library used in src in CMake, so I made a script to be used to compile the binary and generate the file.

[Use here](build_and_run.sh)
